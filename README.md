Writing styles in OpenAI's chatGPT through Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicators

## Why Myers-Briggs

Lots of people seem to think that the Myers-Briggs Type Indicators are linked to a certain persistent characteristics in a persons personality, including their writing style.

Whether this belief actually holds true for any particular individual over time is less important in this context.

The fact that people have written about assumed personality traits, and derived writing styles, in the close context of the Type Indicators should suffice to make them work in the kinds of LLM's that chatGPT and similar technologies are based on.

I have initially included four personas.

I welcome pull requests for more personas.
